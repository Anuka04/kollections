This project is led by Code Sherpas (https://www.code-sherpas.rocks/)

This is an open source project to fill a gap that Kotlin Standard Library currently has. This gap is the lack of common and basic data structures in Computer Science. This project has two goals:

- let everybody that want contribute to learn data structures
- achieve a mature enough state in order to make Kotlin maintainers consider to include this project in the Kotlin Standard Library
